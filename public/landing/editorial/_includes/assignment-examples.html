            <p>While we realize that happiness is hard to quantify, the happiness index at Aranca Editorial soars pretty high. This could be attributed to the enviable work-life balance that the team enjoys. A diverse bunch (linguists, journalists, engineers, etc.) with even more varied interests, what binds us together is our love for the English language and a relentless pursuit of excellence. The fact that we get to live out both at Aranca makes us very happy.</p>
            <p>Our editors take great pride in their work, and no good work goes unrewarded at Aranca. We understand the virtuous circle of appreciation: employees getting recognition for their achievements will, more often than not, churn out quality work, winning them more accolades. This meritocratic environment plays an important part in fostering individual and company growth. </p>
            <p>At Aranca Editorial, talent, skill, and creativity are given the right direction, with a huge emphasis placed on learning. Extraordinary results are achieved through a combination of structured dissemination of information and skill development.</p>
            <p>Decision-making is decentralized, promoting employee involvement. Successes, be it on the professional or personal front, are celebrated by all. In this crucible of excellence and creative ideas, lifelong bonds are formed. This allows us to work as a team and do great things.</p>
